## Culture code
### **Mission statement**

!!! important "Mission statement"

    We are Fortytwo, we have the answers, always. If we don’t have them already in our toolbox we will figure it out. Our customers have the questions and use-cases. We want to work as part, and side-by-side with our customers as partners to solve real problems to simplify business with modern technology. We are always genuine and up-front. We are different.

### **How we make decisions**

Each employee is expected to seek advice and perspective as appropriate. “Use good judgment” is our core concept.

**Some helpful guardrails**

*    All employees can make purchase decisions under 5.000,- NOK
*    Over 5 KNOK seek peer review.
*    Over 50-100 KNOK, all employees with peer review \_can\_ make decision by themselves but good practise is to have a manager involved.
    
At Amesto Fortytwo, we encourage our employees to be independent decision-makers and to only consult their manager when they are unsure of the best course of action. To support this, we believe that it is the leader's role to provide clear context so that others have the necessary information to make informed and generally sound decisions.

### **How we give feedback**

We believe in providing candid, timely, and in-person feedback to our customers, managers, and colleagues. We don't wait for scheduled 1-on-1 reviews, performance reviews, or project meetings to give feedback, whether it is positive or constructive. We are committed to honesty and open communication in all of our interactions.

### **How we take ownership**

We strive to foster a culture of "extreme" ownership among our colleagues. This means that no one says "it's not my job" and we all work together to build a strong company, maintain our integrity, deliver high-quality services to our customers and partners, and feel a sense of responsibility for the overall success of the company. We believe that by working together and taking ownership of our actions and outcomes, we can achieve great things.

### **How we stand tall for our principles**

We recognize that there are many opportunities and projects that we should be a part of, as well as many that we should avoid. This includes non-ethical, non-diverse, or political endeavors, as well as projects or deliveries that are not aligned with our core values and would demotivate our employees. We are willing to turn down business if it is not a good fit for our company and our commitment to ethical and diverse practices.

### **How we innovate**

We encourage all employees to invest time in innovating new solutions, products, and ways of doing things that will make us and our customers more effective and create more business value through technology. We believe that every employee plays a crucial role in building a strong and innovative culture within our company. We encourage open-mindedness and creativity in all areas.
  
A balanced mix of customer work, time off, low cortisone levels, good health, and time to think and work on your ideas is essential for fostering an innovative climate. By ensuring that our employees have the necessary resources and support to maintain a healthy work-life balance, we can create an environment where creativity and innovation can thrive.

### **How we take time off**

Our vacation policy is simple: "take vacation." We don't have any strict rules or forms regarding the number of weeks per year that you must take. We recognize that work and personal time can often overlap, with employees doing email and chat at odd hours or taking off a weekday afternoon. However, we encourage all employees to set a good example by taking regular vacations, which often leads to fresh ideas, renewed energy and better health.

### **How we are transparent and share everything**

We believe in fostering an open and transparent culture by sharing everything. Nearly every document is fully accessible to all employees, who are encouraged to read and comment on them. This includes financial results, successes, visions, product development and P&Ls, which are shared through easily understandable reports. By sharing this information with the entire team, we aim to create a collaborative and informed environment where everyone can contribute to the success of the company.

### **How we recruit**

We understand that recruitment can be challenging and we are always on the lookout for talented individuals who would be a good fit for our company. We believe in building a high competence density, but not at the expense of team spirit or quality. To minimize the risk of making a wrong hiring decision, we require all new employees to have conversations with at least two different people before being given the final approval for hiring. This helps us ensure that we are bringing on board individuals who will contribute positively to our team and culture.

### **How we handle personal equipment**

We believe in building a culture of trust and respect. We trust our employees to make good decisions and to act in the best interest of the company. We also believe in empowering our employees to choose the personal equipment that they need to do their job effectively, using common sense and good judgment. By fostering this level of trust and autonomy, we hope to create a positive and productive work environment where everyone can thrive.

### **How we develop ourself**

We value the professional development of our employees and invest in their growth through events, training, certifications, and more. However, we recognize that the most impactful way to enhance our team's competence is through meaningful and motivating project or product development opportunities. By providing our employees with the resources and support they need to learn and grow, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

### **How we take care of ourself**

We believe that achieving a good work-life balance is essential for the well-being and productivity of our employees. To support this, we encourage all employees to practice mindfulness and engage in physical activity multiple times a week, even during work hours if necessary. Our offices are equipped with facilities to support mindfulness and relaxation, as well as physical training, to help our team maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life.

### **How we work towards high competence density**

We believe that teams who work in high competence density environments perform and thrive better. We are committed to delivering high-quality work and do not tolerate mediocrity. If an employee is not motivated to give their best effort at work, we encourage them to be frank and upfront about it and work with their manager to find a solution. 

If it is agreed that a change is needed, we will be helpful in finding work elsewhere or providing a severance package. We do not believe in using long-term non-compete contracts or lengthy notice periods as a means of retention.

### **How we handle job titles**

At Fortytwo, job titles are not tied to salary or level of access within the organization. Instead, they are a way to recognize and honor competence and expertise both internally and externally. There is no one person or leadership that has the authority to decide who should hold a particular title, such as "Cloud Consultant" or "Senior" or "Principal." Instead, the highest ranking consultants in the company are responsible for determining who should be given a new title. To be eligible for a promotion, a person must receive a vote of approval from at least 60% of their principal peers. 

If you believe that someone deserves a promotion, you can help make it happen by scrambling the Principals for a vote. Our common expectations and definitions of roles and titles should be honored and continuous maintained https://docs.amestofortytwo.com/Internal%20-%20Docs/Internal%20-%20Docs/teams-and-org-structure/
