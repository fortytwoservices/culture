# Open Source

We value honesty, transparency and sharing. These values are all part of the Open Source Software (OSS) community, a community that we all depend on to build our products and services. This document contains our OSS strategy and a summary of our prioritized community efforts.

1. If our code has no sensitive information (of any sort), there are no reason for it to be private.
2. We strive to promote and contribute to the Open Source projects that we use.
3. Fortytwo encourages our employees to get involved in Open Source, either by contributing code or time.
