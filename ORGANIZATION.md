# Our organization

At Fortytwo, we operate with a "flat organization" structure, which means we keep the number of management and overhead levels to a minimum. We believe that having flexible, autonomous, and self-service teams for customer delivery and product development is the best way to serve our customers and employees. This structure allows all of our employees to be part of a team and product development that is bigger than themselves, which results in better performance, better work-life balance, and higher-quality deliverables for our customers.
